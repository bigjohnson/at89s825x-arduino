## Some intel hex test files

`blink.hex` is a program that blinks the leds connected to all P2 and P3 ports. The cathode must be connected to the port, the anode to a 330 Ohm resistor connected to +5V.

`lorem.hex` is a sample text of 2048 bytes, the same of AT89S8252 data space, for test data write and read.

`40.hex` file of at89s8253 signature size.

`41.hex` file of at89s8253 signature size plus one byte for test pourpose.

`800.hex` file of at89s8252/3 data size.

`801.hex` file of at89s8252/3 data size plus one byte for test pourpose.

## the following files run the blink test program and has a lorem ipsum fake data after it.

`2000.hex` file of at89s8252 program size.

`2001.hex` file of at89s8252 program size plus one byte for test pourpose.

`3000.hex` file of at89s8253 program size.

`3001.hex` file of at89s8253 program size plus one byte for test pourpose.
